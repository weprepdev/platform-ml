## Video Generation
The video generation section of this repository explores various techniques and models for generating videos. It includes implementations of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The models are trained on diverse datasets to generate realistic and visually appealing videos.
## Audio Analysis
In the audio analysis section, we focus on extracting meaningful information from audio data. One of the key libraries used is the Pitch Detectors Library, which provides functionality for pitch detection and analysis. The repository includes examples and code snippets demonstrating how to utilize the Pitch Detectors Library for various audio analysis tasks.
## Emotion Analysis
The emotion analysis section aims to detect and classify emotions from different data modalities, such as text, audio, and video. It incorporates machine learning models trained on labeled datasets to accurately recognize and categorize emotions. The repository provides implementations of popular emotion analysis techniques and datasets for experimentation and evaluation.
## Engagement Analysis
Engagement analysis is crucial for understanding user interaction and satisfaction. This section of the repository focuses on developing models and algorithms to measure and predict user engagement. It includes techniques such as attention tracking, sentiment analysis, and user behavior modeling. The goal is to provide insights into user engagement patterns and optimize user experiences.
